# ITI_Test_Automation_41
Designing Test Automation Framework Course

This Repo is showing good and bad examples of test automation and implementing different designs for the same task .

It starts with the basic implementation of a testcase -> implement Page Object Model -> implement BrowserActions and UiActions -> Enhance browser and UiActions to be able to make a parallel execution and handle multiple drivers -> Create File wrappers and test xmls -> reporting -> .. etc 


Please don't copy the code unless you know the differences between each implementation and when to use each. Feel free to contact me for any questions.
